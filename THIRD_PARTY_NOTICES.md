## Development references

[REFramework](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework) and
[UEVR](https://github.com/praydog/UEVR) by praydog were consulted as DX12,
hooking, OpenXR, and VR architecture references during initial development.
Their source trees are not compiled, committed, or distributed as part of
Witcher 3 VR.

Early private builds obtained MinHook through REFramework's dependency tree.
The public dependency setup instead retrieves MinHook directly from its
official upstream repository under the license reproduced below.

## NVIDIA NGX SDK headers

- Source repository: https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/Streamline
- Pinned revision: `e8aaa6eaac968711fb62473d4ae8256dde20919b`
- Governing license:
  https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/Streamline/blob/main/external/ngx-sdk/license.txt

The dependency setup retrieves NVIDIA NGX SDK interface headers from the
official Streamline repository. NVIDIA SDK materials are not licensed under
the Witcher 3 VR MIT License and must not be redistributed as a standalone
SDK.

Required NVIDIA notice:

> This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA Corporation.

No NVIDIA game DLL or standalone SDK package is distributed by Witcher 3 VR.
Users must rely on the DLSS/NGX runtime supplied with their legally installed
game and compatible NVIDIA driver.

## Bundled OptiScaler integrations

One custom OptiScaler V23244 is bundled under GPL-3.0 with its upstream license.
The old ordinary OptiScaler runtime is not included. The two private AMD
FidelityFX frame-generation helpers retain AMD's MIT license and do not replace
the original game's libraries.

- Source repository: https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler

The DLSS Neural Rendering integration is based on
[Dagherbou / OptiScaler_DLSSNR](https://github.com/Dagherbou/OptiScaler_DLSSNR).
The bundled stereo-compatible sources and NGX forwarder are available from
[OptiScaler_DLSSNR_VR, V23244](https://github.com/tig3rmast3r/OptiScaler_DLSSNR_VR/tree/v23244).
This revision performs neural rendering before DLSS and preserves separate
per-eye history and render-subrect authority.
The pre-DLSS implementation is adapted from
[sadbee166's OptiScaler_DLSSNR PR #6](https://github.com/Dagherbou/OptiScaler_DLSSNR/pull/6),
head commit `914963ffb641943fba8f19f3c8654f0620fc68ac`.
The custom `nvngx.dll_dlssnr.dll` is a forwarding component, not NVIDIA's
`nvngx_dlssnr.dll`. NVIDIA DLSS5 DLLs are not included.

## OFXR Bridge

OFXR Bridge v0.2.1 (V116) is included as a separate, replaceable OpenXR layer DLL under
LGPL-3.0-or-later. No tray application is included or required.

- Corresponding source: https://github.com/tig3rmast3r/OFXR-Bridge/tree/0.2.1
- The OptiScaler-embedded experimental NVIDIA implementation is provided by
  the V23244 source above; the stand-alone layer remains v0.2.1.
- License texts: `licenses/OFXR-LGPL-3.0.txt` and `licenses/GPL-3.0.txt`.
- AMD FidelityFX optical flow is linked under the notice in
  `licenses/AMD-FidelityFX-MIT.txt`.
- NVIDIA Optical Flow interface notices are retained in
  `licenses/NVIDIA-Optical-Flow-Headers.txt`. The driver supplies its runtime;
  no NVIDIA Optical Flow SDK binary is distributed.

license in `licenses/Dear-ImGui-MIT.txt`.

## PureDark AFW

## RenderDoc in-application API and optional runtime

- Source repository: https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc
- Pinned revision: `e43b7c14d3c37fab664391db94f7586be29e49a0`
- Vendored file: `renderdoc/api/app/renderdoc_app.h`

The RenderDoc API header is distributed under the MIT license included in the
header. The separate optional RenderDoc Addon contains the custom V1273
RenderDoc 1.45 runtime derived from upstream commit
`2fc0bc04cb95499635f63986a55bc6f67849dd9f`. The addon includes the upstream
MIT license and is not required to play Witcher 3 VR.

## ReShade VR

The bundled ReShade runtime is an unofficial build of ReShade 6.8.0 with the
V1530 DirectX 11/12 interoperability correction. Credit for ReShade belongs to
Patrick Mours and the upstream contributors.

- Upstream: https://github.com/crosire/reshade
- Fork: https://github.com/tig3rmast3r/ReShade_VR
- Source tag: `v6.8.0-vr-v1530`
- License: BSD 3-Clause; original terms reproduced below.

## CD PROJEKT RED fan content

Witcher 3 VR is an unofficial fan work and is not approved or endorsed by
CD PROJEKT RED and requires a legally obtained copy of The Witcher 3: Wild
Hunt.

The optional Fast Transitions DLC contains a modified Geralt behavior graph.
Its foundation is the **Next Gen Movement Input Lag Fix — Fumio Edition**
(Nexus Mods project 7586); Witcher 3 VR adds narrowly scoped transition changes
for direct run starts and quick reversals. This component and the underlying
REDengine game data are not relicensed under Witcher 3 VR's MIT License.
